Mikan AI SaaS Product Development

Purpose: Manage the development process of a new AI SaaS product from ideation to launch.

Idea: A minimalist daily to do AI assistant that proactively helps you get things done.

Components:

- Knowledge Base: Market research reports, competitor analysis, materials specifications
- Chats: Brainstorming sessions, design iterations, problem-solving discussions
- Artifacts: Systems design, product architecture, tech stack, marketing copy drafts

Benefits: Keep all product-related information in one place, use Claude for creative ideation, and track the evolution of the product design.

I'm a technical founder with full-stack engineering and UI/UX design skills looking to refine and validate an AI SaaS product idea. I'd like your help with concept refinement, market validation, and product architecture planning.

**RESEARCH REQUEST:** Please use Claude Research to gather current market data, competitor analysis, and recent developments as we work through this.

**My Product Concept:**
A minimalist daily to do AI assistant that proactively helps you get things done.

**Target Market:**

- Type: B2C
- Industry/Domain: Productivity and AI
- Primary Users: People who want a minimalist but powerful productivity application.

**Current Stage:**

- Early planning and validation stages.
- Spend less time organizing to do lists, tags, and content using AI to get things done.
- Make it your morning ritual, sit down for a coffee and lock-in your tasks for the day.

**Feature Ideas**

1. Capture context, quickly and without friction be able to:
   1. Quickly capture/input content like links, documents, images, videos, audio, and text
   2. Uses sources like a quick capture UI, MCP servers, files, folders, screenshots, meetings, integrations, tweets, emails, messages, and calendars
2. Uses AI to create your personal productivity context:
   1. Automatically associates relevant content to a to do task
   2. Organizes associated and unassociated content
   3. Enrich to do tasks with content data
   4. Allow for manually adding content to a to do task
3. Your AI productivity companion:
   1. Proactively encourages you to start a task by getting it started for you. It helps get the ball rolling, starting a task is often the hardest part.
      1. When it can, it will draft email or message replies, summaries, outlines, research, web search, RAG search, meeting invites, and other content for your review and iteration.
      2. It uses your writing style and tone based off a few options. It also tunes it off your personal productivity context.
      3. It does not nag and it is not annoying. It's your companion to getting things done.
   2. Organizes your content and to do tasks so you don't have to. Make productivity apps productive and not time wasted tagging, sorting, assigning, and organizing your tasks.

Please help me:

1. **Refine the concept** by identifying potential gaps, improvements, or pivots
2. **Validate market opportunity** with TAM/SAM/SOM analysis and competitive research
3. **Design the AI/ML architecture** focusing on LLMs, Computer Vision, MCP, Multimodal input, Vector Database, Local Context, and RAG
4. **Plan go-to-market strategy** including pricing, channels, and competitive positioning
5. **Identify similar ideas/inspirations** that could inform our approach. Inspirations for some features <https://lazy.so>, <https://superlist.com>, and <https://ugmonk.com/pages/analog>. Attached are some UI/UX inspiration for the main view of the application.

**THINKING REQUEST:** Please use extended thinking to work through complex strategic decisions and show your reasoning process.

**ARTIFACT REQUEST:** Create deliverable artifacts for key insights (market analysis, architecture diagrams, competitive matrices).

Start with concept refinement and market validation. Search for recent market data and competitor information before providing analysis. Ask clarifying questions to ensure you understand the vision clearly before we move to technical architecture and go-to-market planning.
