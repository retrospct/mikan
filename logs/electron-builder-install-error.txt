└─ Failed in 411ms at /Users/leejustin/src/vibe/mikan/apps/desktop
 ELIFECYCLE  Command failed with exit code 1.

KEY ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- The error occurs during the postinstall script for apps/desktop
- The command being executed is: electron-builder install-app-deps --disable-rebuild
- The error message is: "Unknown argument: disable-rebuild"
- This suggests that the electron-builder version being used doesn't recognize the --disable-rebuild flag
- The offending path is: /Users/leejustin/src/vibe/mikan/apps/desktop

NEXT STEPS:
1. Check electron-builder version and documentation for the correct flag syntax
2. Verify if --disable-rebuild is the correct flag name or if it has been deprecated/renamed
3. Check the package.json postinstall script in apps/desktop to see where this flag is defined
